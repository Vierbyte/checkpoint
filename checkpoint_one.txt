Front-facing side of an application which usesrs see and interact with.

20) What does backend / server side mean?
backend/server side are the elements behind the scenes of an application such as databases.

and - returns True if both statements are true.
or - returns True if one of the statements is true.
not - reverse the result, returns False if result is True

33) How can we decide to run one piece of code versus another? Provide an example.
A conditional statement.
ex:
light_is_on = False

if light_is_on:
  print("The light is on!")

else:
  print("We're in the dark.")
